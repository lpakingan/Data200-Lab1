# DATA 200 Lab 1: CheckMyGrade Application

  ## Description
  CheckMyGrade is an object-oriented application that allows for the storing, displaying, and retrieval of grades. The application allows for the evaluation of personal grades for student, course grades for professors, and searches for student records. To store and retrieve 
  grades, CheckMyGrade implements data structures such as arrays and linked lists for optimized accessing of stored data.
